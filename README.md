## 1. Introduction

This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to onboard participants into a dataspace based on Eclipse Dataspace Components. It implements the following main
features:

- deploying base infrastructure, consisting of an IssuerService and a Provisioner agent
- onboarding participants by deploying a dedicated IdentityHub, Control Plane and Data Plane for each participant
- requesting verifiable credentials from the IssuerService by using the IdentityHub's Identity API

To keep things simple, all resources are deployed on a single Kubernetes cluster.

## 2. Definition of terms

- _user_: a person interacting with various APIs that one particular _participant_ exposes
- _base infrastructure_: the IssuerService and the Provisioner agent, which are deployed once per data space
- _participant_: a participating entity in a dataspace, e.g. a company or an organization. This is NOT a human being, but rather a legal entity.
- _participantContext_: technically, IdentityHub is multi-tenant, so it could handle multiple participants in one instance. In this PoC, however, each
  participant gets its own IdentityHub instance, so there is only one participantContext per IdentityHub. A _participantContext_ is identified by its
  _participantContextId_, which - for the purposes of this PoC - is identical to the participant's DID.
- _verifiable credential_: a structured, cryptographically verifiable claim about a _participant_ that is issued by an _issuer_ and held by a _holder_. A VC is
  a JSON document, secured by a proof, e.g. a digital signature.
- _issuer_: an entity that issues verifiable credentials to participants. In this PoC, the IssuerService is the issuer. An issuer must be trusted by the
  participants.
- _holder_: an entity that holds verifiable credentials. In this PoC, the IdentityHub acts as the holder.

## 3. Prerequisites and requirements

### 3.1 Prerequisites

In order to deploy the base components of this PoC, the following things are required:

- a fresh Kubernetes cluster
- NGINX ingress controller installed, e.g. by running:

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.13.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
  ```

- `kubectl` installed on dev machine
- either Terraform or OpenTofu (recommended) installed on dev machine
- a GitHub account and a PAT (needed to [authenticate to
  GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry))
- a POSIX-compliant shell
- this repository cloned locally
- Windows _might_ be supported as base OS, but paths may need to be adapted. We've only tested on macOS.

_All shell commands are assumed to be executed from the repository root unless stated otherwise._

### 3.2 Kubernetes network requirements

This PoC uses an NGINX ingress controller to route HTTP requests to all the individual services and make them accessible from outside the cluster.

On local Kubernetes development installations _other than KinD_, for example Proxmox VMs or bare metal, the Ingress Controller service won't automatically get
an external IP if the service type is `LoadBalancer` (`ClusterIP` will only be reachable from inside the cluster), so we need another service to do that.
MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, which works well for this purpose. Please follow the instructions on the [MetalLB
installation page](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) to install it on your cluster.

MetalLB needs an IP address pool to allocate external IPs from. This should be a range of IPs that are not used by other devices on your network. Whichever IP
MetalLB assigns to the Ingress Controller, you will use that IP ("kubeHost" or "Kubernetes external IP") to access the APIs of the IssuerService, the
Provisioner and the participants.

Note that most cloud providers assign an external IP to the cluster, so MetalLB is not needed there.

Note also, that on KinD, the situation is slightly different: there is a special [installation procedure](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress) when using
NGINX ingress with KinD.

## 4. Getting started

### 4.1 Deploy base infrastructure

In order to install the base components (IssuerService and Provisioner agent) on the cluster, simply run

```shell
GH_PAT=ghp_...
GH_USERNAME=...
tofu -chdir=deployment apply -var ghcr_pat=$GH_PAT -var ghcr_username=$GH_USERNAME
```

and confirm by typing `yes`. After Terraform has completed, inspect the pods by typing `kubectl get pods -n poc-issuer` and `kubectl get pods -n
poc-provisioner`. The output should be similar to this:

```shell
NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dataspace-issuer-service-5d68c4cdf8-v2r5b   1/1     Running   0          3m25s
issuer-postgres-6cfc666468-5b7ww            1/1     Running   0          3m27s
issuer-vault-0                              1/1     Running   0          3m24s
```

and

```shell
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
provisioner-5bf555d7dd-87stz   1/1     Running   0          3m32s
```

Note that according to documentation, OpenTofu/Terraform _should_ respect the `$KUBECONFIG` variable, but that doesn't seem to be the case in all instances.
Therefor, the Terraform scripts reference `~/.kube/config` directly.

### 4.2 Seeding initial data

The IssuerService requires some inital data which we'll insert by executing the seed script. In the subsequent example, the Kubernetes external IP is
`192.168.1.230`, please substitute it to fit your local setup:

```shell
./seed-k8s.sh --host 192.168.1.230
```

executing this script repeatedly will log an error ("ObjectConflict") but that is OK. It should produce an output similar to this:

```text
Seeding data to ingress host 192.168.1.230

Create dataspace issuer
{"apiKey":"ZGlkOndlYjpkYXRhc3BhY2UtaXNzdWVyLXNlcnZpY2UucG9jLWlzc3Vlci5zdmMuY2x1c3Rlci5sb2NhbCUzQTEwMDE2Omlzc3Vlcg==.67AUWcBwiT11c/pUTyPKBOvNgyd/0n6vshttQksILmqgZN1WZw8i50Ww4D2Fc3+3kNpDJSFNc5ZL1NJOb+CqTA==","clientId":"did:web:dataspace-issuer-service.poc-issuer.svc.cluster.local%3A10016:issuer","clientSecret":"Jl5aAhoNlYANn5HA"}

Create attestation definition (membership)

Create attestation definition (dataprocessor)

Create credential definition (membership)

Create credential definition (dataprocessor)
```

### 4.3 Create participants

Onboarding a participant can be done by executing a simple HTTP request, only the participant's name and its [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/) is required.
For the purposes of this PoC, the DID is constructed as follows:

```something
"did:web:identityhub.<NAME>.svc.cluster.local%3A7083:<NAME>"
```

Note that in production scenarios this will likely be different - DIDs are supposed to be stable identifiers that _cannot change_ over the lifetime of a
participant.

The participant name should be a sequence of alphanumeric characters, starting with a character and without blanks or special symbols. Again, assuming
`192.168.1.230` as the cluster external IP, create the participant by executing

```shell
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.230/provisioner/api/v1/resources \
  -d '{
        "participantName": "fulcrum07",
        "did": "did:web:identityhub.fulcrum07.svc.cluster.local%3A7083:fulcrum07",
        "kubeHost":"192.168.1.230"
      }' \
  -H "content-type: application/json"
```

The provisioner will respond immediately with a list of services that are being provisioned:

```json
{
  "fulcrum07": "Namespace",
  "controlplane": "Service",
  "controlplane-config": "ConfigMap",
  "dataplane": "Service",
  "dataplane-config": "ConfigMap",
  "did": "Ingress",
  "identityhub": "Ingress",
  "ih-config": "ConfigMap",
  "ingress-controlplane": "Ingress",
  "ingress-dataplane": "Ingress",
  "initdb-config": "ConfigMap",
  "participants": "ConfigMap",
  "postgres": "Deployment",
  "postgres-config": "ConfigMap",
  "postgres-service": "Service",
  "vault": "Service"
}
```

The provisioning process is _asynchronous_. That means, in order to know when the provisioner has finished, we must inspect the provisioner's logs with `kubectl
logs -n poc-provisioner provisioner-XXXXXXXXXX-YYYYY` to see the progress of the deployment. It should look something like this:

```text
Waiting for deployments [controlplane identityhub dataplane]
Deployment controlplane ready
Deployment identityhub ready
Deployment dataplane ready
Deployments ready in namespace fulcrum07 -> seeding data
assets created
policies created
contract definitions created
participant created
issuer account created for participant  fulcrum07
Data seeding complete in namespace fulcrum07
```

(an alternative would be to wait for individual deployments with `kubectl wait deployment identityhub --namespace fulcrum02 --for=condition=available
--timeout=60s`)

### 4.4 Delete a participant

Similar to the provisioning request, a participant can be de-provisioned by executing

```shell
curl -X DELETE http://192.168.1.239/provisioner/api/v1/resources \
  -d '{
        "participantName": "fulcrum07",
        "kubeHost": "192.168.1.230"
      }' \
  -H "content-type: application/json"
```

this also is an asynchronous operation, so the provisioner will respond immediately with HTTP 20x. The actual deletion progress can be observed by inspecting
the pods in the participant's namespace, e.g. by executing `kubectl get pods -n fulcrum07 -w` until all pods are gone.

### 4.4 Requesting a credential

After the participant has been created, it can request verifiable credentials from the IssuerService. For this, we use the participant's "IdentityApi" to talk
to the participant's IdentitHub, which is basically the management API of the IdentityHub. Again, assuming `"192.168.1.230"` as the cluster external IP, we can
request credentials by executing

```shell
curl --location 'http://192.168.1.239/fulcrum07/cs/api/identity/v1alpha/participants/ZGlkOndlYjppZGVudGl0eWh1Yi5hcnViYTA3LnN2Yy5jbHVzdGVyLmxvY2FsJTNBNzA4MzphcnViYTA3/credentials/request' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: c3VwZXItdXNlcg==.c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LWtleQo=' \
--data '{
    "issuerDid": "did:web:dataspace-issuer-service.poc-issuer.svc.cluster.local%3A10016:issuer",
    "holderPid": "credential-request-1",
    "credentials": [{
        "format": "VC1_0_JWT",
        "type": "MembershipCredential",
        "id": "membership-credential-def"
    },
    {
        "format": "VC1_0_JWT",
        "type": "DataProcessorCredential",
        "id": "dataprocessor-credential-def"
    }]
}'
```

Key elements to note here are:

- the URL contains the base64-encoded identifier of the participant, which should be identical to the participant's DID
- the `issuerDid` determines, where to send the issuance request. technically, in a dataspace, there could be multiple issuers
- the `holderPid` is an arbitrary ID that can be chosen by the (prospective "holder" of the credential)
- each object in the `credentials` array determines, which credential is to be requested. This information is available via the issuer's [Metadata
  API](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/v1.0-RC4/#issuer-metadata-api), and here, we're requesting two credentials at once.
  Note that it is also possible to make two individual requests, but the `holderPid` then has to be different each time.

Credential issuance is also an asynchronous process, so the request immediately returns with HTTP 201. After a while, the IdentityHub's logs should display
something similar to:

```text
identityhub DEBUG 2025-08-26T06:42:38.697336738 [CredentialRequestManagerImpl] HolderCredentialRequest credential-request-1 is now in state CREATED
identityhub DEBUG 2025-08-26T06:42:39.493424722 Processing 'CREATED' request 'credential-request-1'
identityhub DEBUG 2025-08-26T06:42:39.495968114 [CredentialRequestManagerImpl] HolderCredentialRequest credential-request-1 is now in state REQUESTING
identityhub DEBUG 2025-08-26T06:42:39.915779975 [CredentialRequestManagerImpl] HolderCredentialRequest credential-request-1 is now in state REQUESTED
identityhub DEBUG 2025-08-26T06:42:41.205526897 [StorageAPI] HolderCredentialRequest credential-request-1 is now in state ISSUED
```

From that point forward, the `MembershipCredential` and the `DataProcessorCredential` are held by our participant "fulcrum05" and can be used for presentation.

## 5. Components and setup

The PoC consists of two main classes of components:

1. base infrastructure, consisting of the IssuerService and the Provisioner agent
2. participant infrastructure, consisting of the Identity Hub, the Control Plane and the Data Plane plus their dependencies (primarily PostgreSQL and Vault).

The following diagram illustrates the overall architecture:

![Architecture diagram](./docs/images/architecture.svg)

### 5.1 Base infrastructure

The base infrastructure (shown in pink) is deployed once per cluster and consists of the IssuerService and the Provisioner agent. This is done by running the Terraform/OpenTofu
scripts in the `deployment` folder, see [section 3.3](#41-deploy-base-infrastructure) for details.

#### 5.1.1 IssuerService

This is a DCP-compliant issuer service that receives verifiable credential requests from participants and issues the requested credentials. It is based on the
[reference implementation](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub/blob/main/docs/developer/architecture/issuer/issuance/issuance.process.md) of the
[Decentralized Claims Protocol](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol).

In short, the IssuerService uses so-called `CredentialDefinitions` to generate Verifiable Credentials for participants. The data, that is being written into the
credentials comes from so-called `AttestationDefinitions` which are linked to the `CredentialDefinitions`. For this PoC, the data is hardcoded for each
credential type in the IssuerService's [code base](./launchers/issuerservice/src/main/java/org/eclipse/edc/issuerservice/seed/attestation/), but in a production
scenario this data would likely come from an external source, e.g. a database or an API.

#### 5.1.2 Provisioner agent

The provisioner agent is responsible for deploying the participant infrastructure on behalf of an onboarding platform. It exposes a REST API that can be used to
request the provisioning and the de-provisioning of a new participant by providing the participant's name and DID, see [section 4.3](#43-create-participants)
for details.

In practice, the provisioner agent will create the following resources for each participant:

- a control plane: this is the connector's DSP endpoint that handles contract negotiations etc.
- a data plane: this is a (very simple) http data plane to transmit example data
- an IdentityHub: this is the credential storage and DCP implementation
- dependencies like a PostgreSQL database and a Vault for secrets storage.

In addition, the provisioner agent also pre-configures each participant with demo data:

- assets, policies and contract definitions
- an account in its IdentityHub, so that the participant may present its credentials to other participants
- an account on the IssuerService, so that the participant may request credentials to be issued

**Asynchronous operation**: Provisioning participant data may take some time, depending on physical hardware and network layout. Currently, the only way to get
notified when a deployment is ready, is to inspect the logs of the provisioner. In production scenarios, that would likely be handled using an eventing system.

**Multi-tenancy**: In the current PoC, multi-tenancy is implemented by creating a separate Kubernetes namespace for each participant. In production scenarios,
this will likely be different.

_The partitioning agent's source code can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Metaform/fulcrum-provisioner)._

#### 5.1.3 Credential types

In this PoC there are two types of credentials: a `MembershipCredential`, which attests to a participant being an active member of the dataspace, and a
`DataProcessorCredential`, which attests to a participant's access level - either `"processing"` or `"sensitive"`.

When issuing a `MembershipCredential`, the `MembershipAttestationSource` creates the following credential subject:

```json
{
  "membershipStartDate": "<NOW>",
  "membershipType": "full-member",
  "id": "<PARTICIPANT_ID>"
}
```

When issuing a `DataProcessorCredential`, the `DataProcessorAttestationSource` creates the following credential subject:

```json
{
  "contractVersion": "1.0.0",
  "level": "processing",
  "id": "<PARTICIPANT_ID>"
}
```

These credentials are used to authenticate and authorize DSP/DCP requests from one connector to another. Each new dataspace member will receive both
credentials.

### 5.2 Participant infrastructure

The participant infrastructure (shown in purple) is deployed for each participant by the Provisioner agent, see [section 3.4](#43-create-participants) for
details. It includes a control plane, a data plane and an IdentityHub, plus dependencies like PostgreSQL and Vault.

They come pre-configured with some demo data (assets, policies, contract definitions) and an account in the IdentityHub and the IssuerService.
